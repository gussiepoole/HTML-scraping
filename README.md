Scraping and Analysing Mars Weather Data

This assignment is to use web-scraping in order to extract data from the Mars weathether website via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. In this assignment I have practised collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating insights.
