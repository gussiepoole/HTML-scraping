# HTML-scraping - Scraping and Analysing Mars Weather Data

## Project Overview
This assignment uses web-scraping to extract data from the [Mars weather website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html), via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. In this assignment I have practised collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating insights.


I first scraped the data and displayed just one element so I could visualise the data I was scraping

I then scraped all the relevant data and stored it in a list so I could manipulate and select different elements from it, such as temperature and pressure

I created a dataframe with key information from the data I scraped

## Analysis
I then created visualisations based on weather data to clearly show the change in weather:

I analysed the data to gain a better understanding about life on Mars. For example I identified the coldest and warmest months on Mars - the warmest month was 8, with an average of -68.38297872340425 (°C) and the coldest were months were 3 and 4, with an average of -83.30729166666667 (°C).
