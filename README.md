Scraping and Analysing Mars Weather Data

This assignment is to use web-scraping in order to extract data from the [Mars weather website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html), via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. In this assignment I have practised collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating insights.
